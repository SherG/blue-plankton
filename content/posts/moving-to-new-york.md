Planning on a move to New Hampshire? Whether you're going to rent or buy, it helps to have a few tips on winter heating. 

There are a surprising number of methods that New Hampshire homeowners use to heat their homes. These include: 

* Firewood-based heat via wood stove or fireplace. 
* Pellet stoves
* <a href="https://www.vermontcastings.com/Browse/Gas-Stoves.aspx" target="blank">Gas stoves</a>
* Wood or oil-fueled furnace
* Electric baseboard heating
* Radiant floor heating 

My experience is with the first 4, so I'll be focusing on those. 

## Gas Stoves

When I first moved up here my primary source of winter heat was a Vermont Castings propane-powered stove. It was set into a fireplace. The stove was super-efficient: it was really more than was needed to heat the home. 

The stove was connected to a wall-mounted thermostat. This is a great set up especially if you plan on traveling. Set the thermostat and your home will maintain an even temperature.

The stove was also not dependent on electricity: you could start it manually in the event of a power outage.

With the glass front doors on the stove, the fire looked realistic -- even the fake logs looked real. Rest assured, you won't miss out at all on that "cozy" feeling that comes from the visual of a winter fire. 

Best of all you don't have to do any schlepping or storage of firewood.

The cost of running the propane stove is going to depend on the going rate of propane. The highest my bill got was $275/month but it typically ranged from $125- $150 to heat 750 square feet.

## Wood Stoves

I now use a wood stove as my principal source of heat. Wood stoves require a lot more work. But for some people, that's part of the fun.

You have to source good firewood, purchase it in a timely fashion, and either stack it yourself or hire someone to stack it for you. 

### Buying Firewood

You want to avoid being ripped off by someone who sells you "green" firewood that they pass off as ready to burn. This happened to a friend of mine in Vermont. 

> Tip: If you think you've been scammed and have bought green wood, check the ash level in your wood stove first. If it's built up, it can block air flow and create a condition that mimics green wood that won't burn. 

Find a good source — like the town clerk — who can tell you where you can find quality firewood.

I use (and can vouch for) <a href="https://treehuggerfarms.com/" target="blank">Treehugger Farms</a> in Westmoreland, Cheshire County. You can buy seasoned, semi-seasoned, or de-barked, kiln-dried wood (my favorite). 

Their delivery radius is limited but you can also pick up wood there yourself. 

Kiln-dried wood is ready to burn, and catches fire quickly. You also don't have to be concerned about bugs potentially being in the wood. 

That's a plus if you want to stack a good amount inside your home, as I do. I stack about 3-4 weeks' worth. That cuts down on the number of times I have to haul wood from the barn to my home.

Spring is the time to purchase semi-seasoned. You need to give it a good 9 months to dry out. 

#### Semi-Seasoned vs. Kiln-Dried

Semi-seasoned is considerably cheaper than kiln-dried. You can buy a cord of semi-seasoned for about $225. Kiln-dried firewood is currently going for $380/cord. 

* If you live in an average-sized house, count on needing 4-5 cords of firewood 
* If you live in a small house or cabin, count on needing 2-3 cords.
* Count on spending $50 per cord if you want someone to stack it for you

Realize that as late as April and May you may be running your wood stove — at least at night.

Knowing that timing is an important factor in cost of firewood should help you when planning your move.

#### Beware: Firewood Deliveries Might Become Significantly Delayed

It's important to not expect delivery dates to remain the same year after year. They can fluctuate dramatically.

Here's what I mean. 

* The first year I bought firewood, there was a one-week wait for delivery. 
* The second year I bought firewood — from the same source — there was a 2-month wait. 

I had waited late to buy because I had assumed delivery would be within a week. 

The lesson here is: don't assume. Or, assume the worst. 

If you're buying kiln-dried firewood, I wouldn't wait later than September to get your first cord or two. 

The only person responsible for making sure you can get the firewood you need is — you guessed it — you. 

#### Source Kindling

You'll also need make a plan to get kindling - and an adequate amount of it. 

Friends of mine gather their own kindling from the forest floor. I used to buy kindling in giant bags that a local farmer provided for sale at a nearby gas station. Then suddenly, the next year, the farmer stopped providing it. 

Unlike my friends, I don't enjoy foraging for sticks in the woods. So what to do? 

Typically, when the delivery truck dumps your pile of firewood there'll be a good amount of splintering that occurs, and you can get a few weeks of kindling out of that. 

But it wont' be enough to last the winter. 

My preferred option is this: 

1. Buy and use A.W. Perkins Firestarters. \
You can get these a box of 144 of these from Amazon for $25. That's the cheapest price I've found. John, the co-owner of Treehugger Farms, showed me how to start a fire using just one single firestarter and some kindling. Leave your wood stove door cracked and let the fire grow gradually. 

2. Buy a Kindling Cracker. \
This manual device — the brainchild of a New Zealand student — makes splitting your larger logs into small sticks of firewood easy. Insert your log, and tap it with a club. Easy. The Kindling Cracker runs around $99. 

Other options:

1. You can buy a gas-powered log splitter to break your logs into smaller pieces
2. Be a real Yank and use a maul to split your own firewood. (My 83-year old neighbor does this!)

### Get Your Chimney Cleaned Once a Year

In fall you'll want to get your chimney cleaned. This is a safety move: removing any creosote build up will substantially decrease the risk of having a chimney fire. 

## Electric Baseboard Heat

My backup was (and is) electric baseboard heat. However, I'd suggest you avoid using baseboard heat if possible. It really ramps up your electric bill.  

Electricity in New Hampshire costs more per kWh than the national average. (See <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf" target="blank">this chart</a> for state-by-state comparisons. 

As some have pointed out, average monthly electric bills here are below the national average. It's also true that many New Hampshire homes ration their heat (keeping temperatures at 55 or so). 

Many homes here also do not have air conditioning, even though we get summer temperatures in the 90s. So I wonder if these facts play into these statistics. That, and Yankees know _how_ to be — and _enjoy_ being — frugal.
