Typically, the northern part of New Hampshire sees colder temperatures and greater snowfall during winter than the southern counties. That said, I've experienced temperatures as low as -20 °F on multiple - but rare - occasions in Monadnock and Cheshire counties. 

One of my first questions I had before moving up to New Hampshire was "Is my Hyundai enough to make it in the snow?" Carla Gericke assured me that it was. And she was right. I suppose I was  imagining needing a four-wheel drive or something rugged. 

I made the move and settled on Crotched Mountain in Bennington, New Hampshire. I arrived about a month and half before winter. Before moving up I had fun researching tips on how to prepare my vehicle for winter. I hope you'll find this information useful. 

## Engine Checks to Do Before Snow Falls

You can spend between $10-$15 to get some simple automotive tools from Amazon that will help you prepare for winter. 

### Checking Your Brake Fluid and Radiator Fluid

I use: 

* A brake fluid tester 
* A hydrometer

The brake fluid tester is a pen-like device: remove the cap, and stick the protruding metal pins into your brake fluid reservoir. You'll get an instant readout of whether your fluid needs to be changed. 

Next, take the hydrometer and use it to extract some radiator fluid out of the reservoir. The gauge on the hydrometer will tell you if your radiator fluid is due for a change. 

### Sprucing Your Battery Up

I should note here that I've never had my car battery fail in winter here, but it has ailed on occassion during heat waves. (Tip: During a heat wave, don't park your car, running the AC full blast, with laptop and other devices plugged for an extended period of time.)

For winter, I clean my battery terminals and lubricate them to sustain a better connection. I also place felt washers around the base of the terminals. 

## Snow Tires Are a Must

Don't try to wing winter with all seasons on. Having snow tires is essential. This is true whether you're living in a rural area or in a New Hampshire city like Portsmouth, Manchester, or Concord. 

Each winter there are news stories about fatal accidents occurring on well-traveled north-south highways like I-93 and I-81. 

Less-traveled roads that connect rural towns are sometimes not salted. In fact, you'll see road signs in some cases warning that a particular stretch of road does not get salted or gets minimal treatment. 

### Studs or No Studs?

This is going to come down to your preference. When I first arrived, a friend of mine in Vermont advised me to get studded tires. I followed her advice and was glad I did. 

I opted for studded Firestone WinterForce tires, and noticed I was one of the few drivers around with studs.

With those badass tires I was able to zip up and down the snow mountain in my 2-door hatchback when pickup trucks were stuck at the bottom. The WinterForce tires had an aggressive tread and provided great traction.

The new generation of WinterForce tires, unfortunately, doesn't have nearly as aggressive of a tread. 

So when I wore out my first set of snows, four years later, I opted for Nokian tires -- a Finnish brand. Specifically I got the [Hakkapelliita 8](https://www.nokiantires.com/winter-tires/nokian-hakkapeliitta-8/) studded tires. 

The Nokian tires are designed in a way that enables a far greater number of studs to be inserted. Plus the tire provides a rear cushioning for the studs, so that the tires are much quieter than the Firestones when driving on asphalt. 

## Equipment

The equipment required for hiking depends on the length of the hike, but day hikers generally carry at least water, food, a map, and rain-proof gear. Hikers usually wear sturdy hiking boots for mountain walking and backpacking, as protection from the rough terrain, as well as providing increased stability. The Mountaineers club recommends a list of "Ten Essentials" equipment for hiking, including a compass, sunglasses, sunscreen, a flashlight, a first aid kit, a fire starter, and a knife. Other groups recommend items such as hat, gloves, insect repellent, and an emergency blanket. A GPS navigation device can also be helpful and route cards may be used as a guide.

Proponents of ultralight backpacking argue that long lists of required items for multi-day hikes increases pack weight, and hence fatigue and the chance of injury. Instead, they recommend reducing pack weight, in order to make hiking long distances easier. Even the use of hiking boots on long-distances hikes is controversial among ultralight hikers, because of their weight.

## Environmental Impact

Natural environments are often fragile, and may be accidentally damaged, especially when a large number of hikers are involved. For example, years of gathering wood can strip an alpine area of valuable nutrients. and some species, such as martens or bighorn sheep, are very sensitive to the presence of humans, especially around mating season. Generally, protected areas such as parks have regulations in place to protect the environment, so as to minimize such impact. Such regulations include banning wood fires, restricting camping to established camp sites, disposing or packing out faecal matter, and imposing a quota on the number of hikers. Many hikers espouse the philosophy of Leave No Trace, following strict practices on dealing with food waste, food packaging, and other impact on the environment.

Human waste is often a major source of environmental impact from hiking, and can contaminate the watershed and make other hikers ill. 'Catholes' dug 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) deep, depending on local soil composition and covered after use, at least 60 m (200 feet) away from water sources and trails, are recommended to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination.
