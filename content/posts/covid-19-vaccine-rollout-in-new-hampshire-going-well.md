New Hampshire has done a good job of rolling out the COVID-19 vaccination program, and was among the first states to open up appointments to all age groups. 

Anyone 16 years or older can currently book an appointment to get the vaccine. Those in the youngest age group will have a choice of appointments from April 19 on. 

## Vaccinations available to out-of-staters

Our state has so much capacity that it's even <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/04/09/metro/cant-book-covid-19-vaccine-appointment-soon-you-can-get-shot-new-hampshire/" target="blank">opening up vaccination slots to out-of-state residents</a>. This will likely appeal to our Massachusetts friends over the border.

Currently all 3 vaccines are available in New Hampshire: Moderna's, Pfizer's, and Johnson & Johnson's. 

## Using the Vaccine Finder

After doing research, I decided I preferred the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, was able to book an appointment to get it. Realize though, no one can officially guarantee that you'll receive a vaccine made by a particular manufacturer. 

What you can do is use the <a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/" target="blank">Vaccine Finder</a> to search for which vaccines are available at the various sites. Currently, Walmarts in our state only carry the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. As soon as I heard it was available at Walmart, I cancelled my appointment at the mass drive-through site, and booked an appointment at Walmart.

Given my appointment was 2 weeks out, I also visited my local Walmart to ask a few questions. Turns out they're expecting another shipment of vaccines, and that one will also be from Johnson & Johnson. So I have a reasonable expectation that once my appointment arrives (in 8 days) 'll be getting the J&J shot. 

Also realize that none of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines available in New Hampshire were produced at the troubled third-party Baltimore site recently in the news. (*Note: that Baltimore facility is not owned by Johnson & Johnson*.) Also note that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is also referred to as the Janssen vaccine.

### Tip: The Vaccine Finder has up-to-date info

If you use the Vaccine Finder, and click through on the Walmart link, the information you'll see on Walmart is *not up-to-date*. 

* For example, the Vaccine finder may tell you that your local New Hampshire Walmart has Johnson & Johnson vaccines in stock, but clicking through to the Walmart page will tell you that no Walmarts in New Hampshire have any vaccines at all.
* The Vaccine Finder information is accurate and up-to-date, Walmart's generic page is not. (On the Vaccine Finder you'll even see when the "stock" was last updated.) 

The point is, ignore Walmart's website. \
\
1. You need to register through the <a href="https://www.vaccines.nh.gov/" target="blank">New Hampshire state vaccination website</a>. \
2. Once you register, you'll be able to book an appointment at Walmart or another pharmacy. 

## Summary

The COVID-19 vaccines are available in New Hampshire at multiple mass drive-through vaccination sites as well as at pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens.

The Vaccine Finder will not tell you which vaccines are available at the mass vaccination sites - only which ones are currently in stock at pharmacies.
