New Hampshire has done a good job of rolling out the COVID-19 vaccination program, and was among the first states to open up appointments to all age groups. 

Anyone 16 years or older can currently book an appointment to get the vaccine. Those in the youngest age group will have a choice of appointments from April 19 on. 

Our state has so much capacity that it's even [opening up vaccinations slots to out-of-state residents](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/04/09/metro/cant-book-covid-19-vaccine-appointment-soon-you-can-get-shot-new-hampshire/). This will likely appeal to our Massachusetts friends over the border.

Currently all 3 vaccines are available in New Hampshire: Moderna's, Pfizer's, and Johnson & Johnson's. 

After doing research, I decided I preferred the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, was able to book an appointment to get it. (Realize though, no one can officially guarantee that you'll receive a vaccine made by a particular manufacturer. What you can do is search for a which vaccines are available at the various sites.) 

Also realize that none of the Johnson & Johnson vaccines (also referred to as the Janssen vaccine) available in New Hampshire were produced at the troubled third-party Baltimore site recently in the news. (Note: that Baltimore facility is not owned by Johnson & Johnson.) 

The COVID-19 vaccines are available in New Hampshire at multiple mass drive-through vaccination sites as well as at pharmacies like CVS and Walgreens.
