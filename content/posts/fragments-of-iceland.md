Working from home with a view like the I have is one thing that draws people to consider living in rural New Hampshire.

But beware: there are plenty of cheap places with incredible views, but getting acceptable quality internet service can become an infuriating (and draining) headache. I hope to spare you any troubles by sharing my experiences and tips. 

One of the goals of this blog is to share an unvarnished view of the lifestyle up here. And this post is going to be unvarnished on the negative side.
