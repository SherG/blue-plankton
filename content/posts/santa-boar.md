Last Christmas eve wild boar were spotted running in the ravine out back. Three men doing brush fire work here spotted them. They were excited about their discovery. 

I hadn't realized that there are wild boar in New Hampshire. The sighting me curious to learn more. 

## Wild Boar On the Lam

I was surprised to discover that wild boar in New Hampshire are considered "escaped private property." They belong to the Blue Mountain Forest Association, which is a private hunting preserve over an hour away, in Croydon, New Hampshire.

Because these boar have legal status as private property, they can only be hunted with permission of the owner. Escaped boar are considered to be "[running at large](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xlv/467/467-mrg.htm)."

According to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department permission is usually granted but "legal hunting hours" must be observed. Interestingly, Fish and Game adds: "feral wild boar are limited in number *and are difficult to locate without local knowledge*."

These wild pigs clearly have an incentive to escape and roam free because bureaucracy is on their side. 

Apparently they are most commonly found in Grafton, Cheshire, and Sullivan counties. 

## Corbin Park

The Blue Mountain Forest Association preserve is more commonly known as Corbin Park, and according to *Valley News* it is the only private hunting preserve in New Hampshire and memberships cost well into 5-figures. 

The preserve spans some 25,000 square miles and was created by 19th-century railroad entrepreneur [Austin Corbin](https://web.archive.org/web/20071001001801/http://www.newsday.com/community/guide/lihistory/ny-history_motion_rail1%2C0%2C5977066.story?coll=ny-lihistory-navigation). 

Corbin imported the wild boar from Germany's Black Forest.
