You may be wondering what sort of wildlife you can you expect to see in rural New Hampshire.

 In the past 2 years I've seen: 

* Black bears (twice - hanging out in the middle of the road)
* Coyotes (crossing the road, three at a time, or running on ice shards along the Connecticut River)
* Foxes
* Bobcats
* Deer (infrequently in this area)
* Bald eagles
* A variety of hawks or falcons

We also have the usual assortment of skunks, porcupines, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums, groundhogs, raccoons and other critters you can find in most American states. 

Otters, martens, mink, beavers, and varieties of weasels seem elusive.
