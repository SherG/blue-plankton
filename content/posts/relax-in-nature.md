You may be wondering what sort of wildlife you can you expect to see in rural New Hampshire.

 In the past 2 years I've seen: 

* Black bears (twice - hanging out in the middle of the road)
* Coyotes (crossing the road, three at a time, or running on ice shards along the Connecticut River)
* Foxes
* Bobcats
* Deer (infrequently in this area)
* Bald eagles
* A variety of hawks or falcons

We also have the usual assortment of skunks, porcupines, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums, groundhogs, raccoons and other critters you can find in most American states. 

Otters, martens, mink, beavers, and varieties of weasels seem elusive. 

## What About Wolves or Cougars? 

Officially, there are no cougars in New Hampshire. That means the Fish and Wildlife Departments says there is no evidence of cougars in the area. Locals say otherwise. 

Locals also are adamant that wolves are back in this area. 

## What This Means for Fluffy

Locals will also tell you that it's absolutely not safe to let your cat out. That puts a cramp on cat's natural desire for outdoor adventures. But it's true that every town has a steady flow of new "cat missing" flyers up. 

And every humane society location has one-eyed, one-eared, bob-tailed, and 3-legged cats up for adoption.

That said, my neighbor's cat seems to be a stealthy hunter. (It's also bob-tailed.) It roams this area that's populated with coyote, foxes, and bobats, and seems to hold its own. But it doesn't go out at night. 

_Note: I've seen bobcats out in the morning and afternoon._
