This past winter I looked up from my desk and caught a view of a coyote bounding over the blue-green mountainscape of ice ridges lining the eastern bank of the Connecticut River. 

I ran to the next window and saw there actually two coyotes - one following the other.

During the spring, sitting at the same desk, I looked up to see a bobcat sauntering lazily across the grass. A few months later, a different bobcat made an appearance. 

Once at night I got up to investigate a thump on the back porch, only to see a large owl -- wholly unperturbed by my presence -- sitting on the railing. He simply stared back at me. I'm pretty sure he had just scored a tasty midnight snack. 

This summer, driving up a country two-lane road, I saw the car in front of me had stopped. I pulled up behind him, and quickly saw the reason for the hold-up: a huge black bear. This bear, like the owl, was unruffled by the presence of two cars. He took his time to meander across the road, and carefully inspected the view past the guardrail. 

Not convinced that it was a good idea to complete his road crossing, the bear slowly padded up the side of the road towards my car and crossed diagonally back to the other side. 

It's a thrill to be able to see these magnificent creatures up close in the wild -- even if it's for a few fleeting moments. 

You may be wondering what sort of wildlife you can you expect to see in rural New Hampshire.

* Black bears
* Coyotes 
* Foxes
* Bobcats
* Deer
* Bald eagles
* A variety of owls, hawks or falcons

We also have the usual assortment of skunks, porcupines, rabbits, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums, groundhogs, raccoons and other critters you can find in most American states. 

Otters, martens, mink, beavers, fishers (commonly called fisher cats), and varieties of weasels seem elusive.

## What About Wolves or Cougars?

Officially, there are no cougars in New Hampshire. Specifically, the Fish and Wildlife Departments states that there is no evidence of cougars in the area. 

Many residents are adamant that cougars are present in the state. They say sightings are fleeting and unexpected and that's why no one has produced photographic (or track) evidence. 

Locals also say that wolves have returned to New Hampshire.

## What This Means for Fluffy

They'll also tell you that it's definitely not safe to let your cat out. That puts a cramp on a cat's natural desire for outdoor adventures. 

Every town has a steady flow of new "cat missing" flyers up. And every cat adoption agency has one-eyed, one-eared, no-eared, bob-tailed, and 3-legged cats up for adoption. (No, you can't get a discount for adopting felines with missing parts.)

That said, my neighbor's cat continues to live an indoor-outdoor cat, and is a stealthy hunter. It roams this area that's populated with coyote, foxes, and bobcats, and seems to hold its own. But it does have a sprinkling of tool sheds, barns, garages, and porches to dart under in an emergency. And most of its tail is missing.

> I've seen bobcats and coyotes roaming during daylight. They're not always nocturnal.

If you have a cat, you should also be concerned about birds of prey. New Hampshire has some ferocious raptors including large bald eagles along the Connecticut River.

I once found 3 turkey vultures circling overhead while my cat was taking a nap on the back deck balcony. Thank goodness, turkey vultures don't attack living animals. But still, it made me aware of how quickly a bird of prey could size up your cat while you're only a few feet away.

House cats whose outdoor activities have been limited to chasing butterflies across manicured lawns will probably not survive being let outdoors in New Hampshire. 

Other than the back balcony, I kept my late cat indoors and she chafed against the restriction, developing a form of cabin fever: an occasional mix of irritability and boredom.

If you have the option, choose a home that has enough interior space so that Fluffy the Cat run around at full speed and get adequate exercise.

## Bear Spray

I think it's wise to be prepared for an encounter with a wild animal like a bear, bobcat, or coyote. 

All three usually mind their own business. And it's unlikely you'll have a problem with them if you mind your own business as well.

Exceptions are:

* Rabid bobcats or coyotes
* In the U.S. there have been some rare fatal attacks by black bears 

A simple solution is to buy what's known as "bear spray" and always carry it with you. 

Also - don't try to approach a black bear to get a selfie.

## Rodents -- Less Thrilling

When I moved to New Hampshire, I settled on a ski mountain. The condo had a back deck, and during winter I kept a bird feeder full of an Audubon peanut-cherry mix. 

I (and my cat) loved seeing the variety of visitors we'd attract -- including the increasingly rotund squirrel. 

### Remy the Rat moves in

A few days after watching the animated Pixar movie _Ratatouille_, I looked out and saw Remy the Rat on my deck! Sitting on his hind legs, this rat had is nose stuck up in the air, slowing waving his head around, obviously trying to hone in on the peanut-cherry mix. (The feeder was empty). 

Like Remy, this rat had good taste.

I didn't think much of it. Soon, in the spring, I found out that Remy had decided to make a nest in some piping below the deck. The deck overlooked a sloping hill -- so the Remy clan -- including little rat _bébés --_ was holed up about a story below the deck. 

Turns out that rats inhabit the marshy area a couple of miles from the mountain. When the ice thaws they head to higher ground. 

But why stay on the move if you've got cherry-peanut-seed mix falling like manna from heaven every day? 

Moral of the story: Never put a bird feeder up in New Hampshire. You will get a rodent infestation, guaranteed.

### Look Behind the Stove

In the winter, little field mice would somehow get into the condo walls. I found this out from a neighbor. 

The tiny field mice did sometimes visit my condo. I discovered this because my cat Chloe was suddenly obsessed with peering underneath the stove. 

I pulled the stove away from the wall and saw that someone had sawed a one-foot square hole in the wall where cables from the gas stove passed through. 

So the mice would enter the building, climb up the walls and pop out and visit whichever units they could get access to. 

That situation was handled but be aware: mice will seek to get inside structures in the winter. Temperatures here have gotten as low as -19°F and -27°F with a windchill factor. 

#### Settling Near the Water

Living near a river or stream is going to increase (significantly) the likelihood of having a challenge with rodents. But it can be rectified. 

After moving in to a home on the Connecticut River and heading into the first winter, I put out some mousetraps just to be on the safe side. 

I was dismayed by the number of deer mice I was catching. Worse, some were managing to lick the peanut butter off the traps without springing them, which meant my bait was just attracting more mice. 

Long story short, I had to get a critter control service to come rectify the issue. 

Again: the problem was behind the stove. There was a hole behind the stove that the electrical cable passed through. Deer mice had gotten into the wall through an exterior crack in the foundation. Then they had chewed that interior cable hole until it was wide enough for them to pass through. 

I never had a single rodent problem after the critter control specialists came out. They sealed every crack or hole they could find, and spread out mice poison traps around the outside. 

Note: If your home does not have a basement, they'll tell you that they can guarantee that it's 100% 'sealable.' Mine doesn't have basement and I haven't had a single "visitor" since that winter.
