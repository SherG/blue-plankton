You may be wondering what sort of wildlife you can you expect to see in rural New Hampshire.

 In the past 2 years I've seen: 

* Black bears (twice - hanging out in the middle of the road)
* Coyotes (crossing the road, three at a time, or running on ice shards along the Connecticut River)
* Foxes
* Bobcats
* Deer (infrequently in this area)
* Bald eagles
* A variety of owls, hawks or falcons

We also have the usual assortment of skunks, porcupines, rabbits, chipmunks, squirrels, opossums, groundhogs, raccoons and other critters you can find in most American states. 

Otters, martens, mink, beavers, fishers (commonly called fisher-cats), and varieties of weasels seem elusive.

## What About Wolves or Cougars?

Officially, there are no cougars in New Hampshire. That means the Fish and Wildlife Departments states that there is no evidence of cougars in the area. 

Many residents are adamant that cougars are present in the state. They say sightings are fleeting and unexpected and that's why no one has produced photographic (or track) evidence. 

Locals also are adamant that wolves have returned to New Hampshire.

## What This Means for Fluffy

They'll also tell you that it's definitely not safe to let your cat out. That puts a cramp on a cat's natural desire for outdoor adventures. 

Every town has a steady flow of new "cat missing" flyers up. And every cat adoption agency has one-eyed, one-eared, no-eared, bob-tailed, and 3-legged cats up for adoption. (No, you don't get a discount on adopting felines with missing bits.)

That said, my neighbor's cat continues to live an indoor-outdoor cat, and is a stealthy hunter. (It's also bob-tailed.) It roams this area that's populated with coyote, foxes, and bobats, and seems to hold its own. But it does have a sprinkling of tool sheds, barns, garages, and porches to dart under in an emergency.

> I've seen bobcats and coyotes roaming during daylight. They're not just nocturnal.

If you have a cat, you should also be concerned about birds of prey. New Hampshire has some ferocious raptors including large bald eagles.

I once found 3 turkey vultures circling overhead while my cat was taking a nap on the back deck balcony. Thank goodness, turkey vultures don't attack living animals. But still, it made me aware of how quickly a bird of prey could size up your cat while you're only a few feet away.

House cats whose outdoor activities have been limited to forays across manicured lawns will probably not survive being let outdoors in New Hampshire. 

Other than the back balcony, I kept my late cat indoors and she chafed against the restriction, developing a form of cabin fever: an occasional mix of irritability and boredom.

If you own a cat, this may be a tough decision for you. If you have the option, choose a home that has enough interior space (at least 1,000 square feet I'd say) so that Fluffy the Cat run around at full speed and get adequate exercise. 

## What This Means For You

I think it's wise to be prepared for an encounter with a wild animal like a bear, bobcat, or coyote. 

All three usually mind their own business. And it's unlikely you'll have a problem with them if you mind your own business as well.

Exceptions are:

* Rabid bobcats or coyotes, which can kill you via the initial attack. 
* In the U.S. there have been some rare but fatal attacks by black bears 

A simple solution is to buy what's known as "bear spray" and always carry it with you. 

Also - don't try to approach a black bear to get a selfie.
