Looking for a way to keep mice out of your trash can?

Part of living in rural New Hampshire means there's no garbage collection. That means you need to keep your trash in a large bin then haul it to the dump a couple of times a week.

It's not uncommon to pull out some bags only to see furballs running, and a tiny head, frozen in shock, staring at you from a chew-hole. 

This only has to happen once for you to dread putting the bags in the back of your car!

## Spray your trash bags with Lysol cleaner

I decided to try spraying the bags with Lysol cleaner. 

Perfect! The cleaner dries fast so there's no mess when you go to the dump. And it keeps all critters at bay. 

So skip the long articles with suggestions that don't work, and try this. I think you'll be glad you did.
