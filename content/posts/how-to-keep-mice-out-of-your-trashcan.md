L﻿ooking for a way to keep mice out of your trash can? 

Part of living in rural New Hampshire means there's no garbage collection. That means you'll be keeping your trash bags in a large can outside then lugging them to a dump a couple of times a week.

I﻿t's not uncommon to pull out some bags only to find a furry head poke out frozen in shock.This only has to happen once for you to dread putting the bags in the back of your car.

## S﻿pray your trash bags with Lysol cleaner

A﻿fter reading scores of purported fixes online, I decided to try spraying the bags with Lysol cleaner. Perfect! The cleaner dries fast so there's no mess when you go to the dump. And it keeps all critters at bay.
