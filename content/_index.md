      When I moved to New Hampshire from the Washington, D.C. metro area, I was
      surprised by the number of friends and acquaintances who peppered me with
      questions about rural life here. This blog is inspired by those questions.
      I hope the answers you find here will help you make a smooth move and find
      a better life.
