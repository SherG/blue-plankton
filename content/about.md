When I moved to New Hamsphire from the Washington, D.C. metro area, it was the first time I had lived in a rural town. 

At first, I experienced a bit of culture shock. Where were the familiar signs of everyday life: 7-11s, Burger Kings, or other brightly colored franchises that dotted main intersections and  served as familiar waypoints? 

I soon grew to love the vacation-paced life and the brilliant blue skies poked by miles of pine trees.

After the move I was surprised by the number of friends and acquaintances that were intensely curious about life in New Hampshire.

This blog is for all those who are curious or contemplating a move to live in New Hampshire's farmlands or forests. 

I hope you find it to be an unvarnished account and of practical use.

_Thank you for visiting!_
